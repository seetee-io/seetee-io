This is an _example_ post that will **not** be published.

Here you can write [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

The slug of the article will be the filename of the `.md` file.

## Footnotes

Footnotes can be used like this[^1].

## Images

For inline images use the `<Image>` component.

<Image postId="example" name="logo.png" caption="Seetee Logo" />

Image captions are optional.

All image files (inline images, thumbnail, cover) are expected to be in the following directory:

```
public/assets/blog/<postId>/
```

The `postId` is the filename of the respective post without the `.md` extension.

For example, the image above is expected to be under:

```
public/assets/blog/example/logo.png
```

[^1]: Make sure to use numbers as tags. Words will work as well but then the footnote will be the word which won't look too good.
